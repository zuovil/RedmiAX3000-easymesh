The initial idea is that an openwrt 21.02 router equipped with easymesh and the original redmi ax3000 equipped with easymesh plug-in are used for mesh networking (wireless relay has been used before). After several days, the easymesh plug-in of 21.02 router was compiled and successfully installed. Next is the ax3000 easymesh plug-in installation, also a few days, finally according to the source code ip50xx easymesh compiled out, redmi ax3000 openwrt system version of 18.06, because the overlay space is full can not be installed, After a while you can put it in memory. However, due to the lack of dependencies, the installation failed

最初的构想是一台装了easymesh的openwrt 21.02路由器与原版redmi ax3000 装了easymesh插件进行mesh组网（之前一直都是采用的是无线中继），折腾了好几天终于把21.02的路由器的easymesh插件编译出来了并成功安装。接下来就是ax3000的easymesh插件安装，同样折腾好几天，终于根据源码把ip50xx的easymesh编译出来了，redmi ax3000 的openwrt系统版本为18.06，由于overlay空间满了无法安装，研究了一会可以装到内存里面。装是可以装的，不会报系统架构错误。但是由于缺少依赖，因此安装失败
